# Going Mobile with Flutter and Rust

Cross platform is all the rage it todays mobile market.  Frameworks such a flutter and react native have come along to allow for a single codebase.  Sometimes you need to reach down to the device level and have to know a whole slew  of different languages i.e. Java, Kotlin, C++, Swift, and Objective C just to name a few.  
This becomes extremely tedious and cost prohibitive as you ramp up a team of developers.  What if there was a way to consolidate all the native code as well?
Enter Rust and the flutter_rust bridge.

In this talk we will:
* Introduce the Flutter Rust Bridge.
* Setup a project to use FRB
* Resources to this to the next level.
