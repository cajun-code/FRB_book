# Going Mobile with Flutter and Rust
Cross platform is in the forefront of today's mobile market. Frameworks such as Flutter and React Native allow for a single codebase, which could be an integral part of any application. At times, a developer may need to reach down to the device level, which may require for the developer to have knowledge of several different languages i.e. Java, Kotlin, C++, Swift, and Objective C naming a few prominent ones.

The interaction between them can be extremely tedious and cost prohibitive, as it requires a team of developers. Consider if there was a way to consolidate all the native code as well? Enter Rust and the flutter_rust bridge.

In this talk we will:

* Introducing the Flutter Rust Bridge.
* Setup a project to use FRB
* Resources to this to the next level.
